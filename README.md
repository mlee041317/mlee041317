## ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

## I'm Michelle and I am switching career paths from the fitness field, looking to get my start as a Software Developer! I've recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course where I completed over 500 hours of instruction and putting in incredible work and art into all of my personal projects. I am extremely driven to keep going, and learning all that there is that this field has to offer.
