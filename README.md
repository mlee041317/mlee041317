I recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course where I completed over 500 hours of instruction, including submitting deliverables, projects, and gaining a foundational understanding of technical languages such as Javascript and Python, along with libraries and frameworks such as React, Node, Express, Bootstrap, jQuery, Mongo, SQL, and Django.
